	abstract = {Performance analysis of the existing mechanical products is critical to identifying design defects and improving product reliability. With the advances of information technologies, product operating data collected through continuous condition monitoring (CM) serve as main sources for analysis of performance and detection of anomaly. Most of the existing anomaly detection methods, however, are not effective when CM data are very high dimensional, leading to poor quality of assessment results. Besides, the effects of multiple operating conditions on anomaly detection are seldom considered in these existing methods. To solve these problems, an integrated approach for anomaly detection and critical behavioral attributes identification based on CM data is developed in this research. Gaussian mixed model GMM) is employed to develop a method for clustering of operating conditions. Isolation forest (iForest) method is used to detect anomaly instances, and further to identify the critical attributes related to product performance degradation. The effectiveness of the developed approach is demonstrated by an application with collected operating data of a wind turbine.},

@article{TonyLiu2008,
	abstract = {Most existing model-based approaches to anomaly detection construct a profile of normal instances, then identify instances that do not conform to the normal profile as anomalies. This paper proposes a fundamentally different model-based method that explicitly isolates anomalies instead of profiles normal points. To our best knowledge, the concept of isolation has not been explored in current literature. The use of isolation enables the proposed method, iForest, to exploit sub-sampling to an extent that is not feasible in existing methods, creating an algorithm which has a linear time complexity with a low constant and a low memory requirement. Our empirical evaluation shows that iFor-est performs favourably to ORCA, a near-linear time complexity distance-based method, LOF and Random Forests in terms of AUC and processing time, and especially in large data sets. iForest also works well in high dimensional problems which have a large number of irrelevant attributes, and in situations where training set does not contain any anomalies.},

	abstract = {This paper attempts to characterize failure behaviour of small satellites through statistical analysis of actual in-orbit failures. A unique Small Satellite Anomalies Database comprising empirical failure data of 222 small satellites has been developed. A nonparametric analysis of the failure data has been implemented by means of a Kaplan-Meier estimation. An innovative modelling method, i.e. Bayesian theory in combination with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations, has been proposed to model the reliability of small satellites. An extensive parametric analysis using the Bayesian/MCMC method has been performed to fit a Weibull distribution to the data. The influence of several characteristics such as the design lifetime, mass, launch year, mission type and the type of satellite developers on the reliability has been analyzed. The results clearly show the infant mortality of small satellites. Compared with the classical maximum-likelihood estimation methods, the proposed Bayesian/MCMC method results in better fitting Weibull models and is especially suitable for reliability modelling where only very limited failures are observed. {\textcopyright} 2014 2014 IAA.

@article{Jacklin2019,
	abstract = {The purpose of this report is to determine the failure rate of small-satellite missions launched between the years 2000 and 2016. This analysis considers the rates of both partial and total mission failure, as well as the failures attributable to failure of the launch vehicle. This study observed that between the years of 2000 to 2016, 41.3{\%} of all small satellites launched failed or partially failed. Of these small satellite missions, 24.2{\%} were total mission failures, another 11{\%} were partial mission failures, and 6.1{\%} were launch vehicle failures. The small satellite failure data reveals an increase in the failure rate as the yearly launch rate has increased. The period 2000 to 2008 averaged 15 launches per year, during which 28.6{\%} of the small satellite missions failed or partially failed. The period from 2009 to 2016 averaged 48 launches per year, during which 42.6{\%} of the small satellite missions failed or partially failed. The launch vehicle failure rate for both periods was the same at around 6.1{\%}. The implication is that for modern small satellite missions, almost one out of every two small satellite missions will result in either a total or a partial mission failure. Counting the partial mission successes as “successful missions” reduces the failure rate, but only to 38.2{\%} for the period 2009 to 2016. Appendix A provides a list of the small satellite missions that failed or partially failed during the years 2000 to 2016. The causes of failures are identified when known. Appendix B provides a list of the successful small satellites launched between 2000 and 2016.},

@article{Crowell2011,
	abstract = {Attitude Determination and Control Systems (ADCS) are critical to the operation of satel- lites that require attitude knowledge and/or attitude control to achieve mission success. Furthermore, ADCS systems only operate as designed in the reduced friction, micro-gravity environment of space. Simulating these characteristics of space in a laboratory environment in order to test individual ADCS components and integrated ADCS systems is an important but challenging step in verifying and validating a satellite's ADCS design. The purpose of this thesis is to design and develop an ADCS testbed capable of sim- ulating the reduced fiction, micro-gravity environment of space within the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Space Systems Laboratory. The ADCS testbed is based on a table- top style, three degree of freedom, rotational air bearing, which uses four reaction wheels for attitude control and a series of sensors for attitude determination. The testbed includes all the equipment necessary to allow for closed loop testing of individual ADCS components and integrated ADCS systems in the simulated inertial environment of space. In addition to the physical ADCS testbed, a MATLAB Simulink based model of the ADCS testbed is developed to predict the performance of hardware components and software algorithms before the components and algorithms are integrated into the ADCS testbed. The final objective of this thesis is to validate the operation of the ADCS testbed and simulation to prepare the tool for use by satellite design teams.},

@article{Choi2011,
	abstract = {While numerous anomalies and failures of spacecraft have been reported since the beginning of the space age, space weather effects on modern spacecraft systems have been emphasized more and more with the increase of their complexity and capability. However, the relationship between space weather and commercial satellite anomalies has not been studied extensively. In this paper, we investigate the geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) satellite anomalies archived by Satellite News Digest during 19972009 in order to search for possible influences of space weather on the anomaly occurrences. We analyze spacecraft anomalies for the Kp index, local time, and season and then compare them with the tendencies of charged particles observed by Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) satellites. We obtain the following results: (1) there are good relationships between geomagnetic activity (as measured by the Kp index) and anomaly occurrences of the GEO satellites; (2) the satellite anomalies occurred mainly in the midnight to morning sector; and (3) the anomalies are found more frequently in spring and fall than summer and winter. While we cannot fully explain how space weather is involved in producing such anomalies, our analysis of LANL data shows that low-energy ( {\textless} 100 keV) electrons have similar behaviors with spacecraft anomalies and implies the spacecraft charging might dominantly contribute to the GEO spacecraft anomalies reported in Satellite News Digest.
